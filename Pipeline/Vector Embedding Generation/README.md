## Vector Embedding Generation

Vector Embeddings provide a compact way to represent and infer relationships in a lower-dimensional continuous space leveraging learned patterns, making it possible to predict
missing links effectively. This process involves training a model to represent each entity and relation in the graph as a vector, such that the relationships between them can be
inferred using mathematical operations on their vector representations. Vector embeddings make it possible to apply machine learning techniques like clustering, classification,
and similarity measurement directly on knowledge graphs. These embeddings can also handle high-dimensional data efficiently, reducing the computational cost of working with large
scale knowledge graphs.
